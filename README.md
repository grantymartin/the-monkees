The Monkees

This is a five page site aimed at promoting the Monkees band through our music, our story, events/availability and social music. Each page contains diifrent
snippets of information about the band and their music. As the band was started inthe 60s there is a 60s theme running throughout with
bright background colours and a 60s style background for the header.

UX:

This site is allows the user a better insight to the Monkees band and helps promote their music and availability. 

As a user you can listen to diffrent songs, watch a music video or simply look through varying photo's. Links to the social media pages also allows
for more up to date details and a further insight into the band.

Features:

On our index page their are clear links to everypage which will allow for further detail on the specific topic. This also is followed by a full width video
on larger screen sizes that gives the viewer a greater understanding of the bands music and style.

On the "Our songs" page, there is a selection of diffrent song choices to listen to along with the ablbum cover. This will help the viewer understand the bands music better 
and possibly convince them to search more.

On the "Events" page, there is a mock example of a concert list with all the venues beside it. There is also a form further down the page that will allow the 
viewer to approach the band with a message if they are looking to book a private function.

On the "our story" page there is a opening section that shows a picture of each individual band member followed by a quote of theirs. After this there is a short
description of the bands past and followed by some more photo's on larger screen sizes.

On the "Social Media" page there are clear links to all the bands social media accounts with facebook, Twitter and Youtube. 

There is hover animations spread throughout the site from the header links to the social media icons that just make the ux that little bit better and 
enjoyable.

Links to the Social accounts are currently inactive and the availability form is also not responsive but this si something that could be added in the future.

Everything element and design was made using HTML and CSS. All 

All wireframes and planning was written out in paper before the project was started.

Testing

To test my site I took multiple diffrent approaches. Firstly I used google chrome to inspect my site on diffrent screen sizes and insure it was fully functional.
Following that  I used W3C Validator to insure my code was written properly and correct. 
My 3rd approach to testing my site was to send the site to multiple diffrent people and ask for feedback on user experience. I sent my site to 5 diffrent people
and all said functionally it worked really well.

I asked them all to check every page and all aspects on those pages from the video on the "index page", to the sound pieces on the "our songs" page.

I also made sure that all the people I sent my site to were using diffrent screen sizes which insured a more thorough test.

Throughout the project there were minor issues but the hardest to fix was on the "events/availability" page. When creating the Venue Items and creating an
image background cover with a fade it was difficult. After a lot of diffrent testing I found what I needed to do was rearrange the order in which the backgrounds
covered each other.

Deployment

When first uploading my site to git hub I found that the imgs/ video and sound would'nt appear on git hub but worked perfectly well on the Cloud 9 preview 
site. After working with my tutor we descovered it was due to the reason all the imgs were set as relative links when they should really be absolute.

Credits:
All the information from the site was gained from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees
The events dates info from the "event/availability" page is incorrect and false (simply for the project).

Media
The photos used in this site were obtained either from the following git hub repository(https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/project-assets)
or from the folling sites:

I received inspiration for this project from my Dad in term of the design. I ran with the 60s theme throughout the site seen. There were bright colors
throughoutand there was a groovy header background to fit the theme.
