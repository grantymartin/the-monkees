The Monkees

This is a five page site aimed at promoting the Monkees band through our music, our story, events/availability and social music. Each page contains diifrent
snippets of information about the band and their music. As the band was started inthe 60s there is a 60s theme running throughout with
bright background colours and a 60s style background for the header.

UX:

This site is allows the user a better insight to the Monkees band and helps promote their music and availability. 

As a user you can listen to diffrent songs, watch a music video or simply look through varying photo's. Links to the social media pages also allows
for more up to date details and a further insight into the band.

Features:

On our index page their are clear links to everypage which will allow for further detail on the specific topic. This also is followed by a full width video
on larger screen sizes that gives the viewer a greater understanding of the bands music and style.

On the "Our songs" page, there is a selection of diffrent song choices to listen to along with the ablbum cover. This will help the viewer understand the bands music better 
and possibly convince them to search more.

On the "Events" page, there is a mock example of a concert list with all the venues beside it. There is also a form further down the page that will allow the 
viewer to approach the band with a message if they are looking to book a private function.

On the "our story" page there is a opening section that shows a picture of each individual band member followed by a quote of theirs. After this there is a short
description of the bands past and followed by some more photo's on larger screen sizes.

On the "Social Media" page there are clear links to all the bands social media accounts with facebook, Twitter and Youtube. 

There is hover animations spread throughout the site from the header links to the social media icons that just make the ux that little bit better and 
enjoyable.

Links to the Social accounts are currently inactive and the availability form is also not responsive but this si something that could be added in the future.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
